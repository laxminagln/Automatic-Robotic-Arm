This project is the implementation of a 6 axis robotic arm which can be rotated to any direction manually or automatically.
The automated feature is brought into play with the help of obstacle sensing mechanism. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect
obstacles. When the obstacle comes within the prescribed radius, it gets sensed with the help of the ultrasonic sensor and 
that object is picked by the arm.
